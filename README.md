# Shopify App in Typescript

A little bit of static type checking usually give me a little bit of relieve when updating and
refactoring codes.

## Getting Started

To run a development servers:

```shell
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

To run a production servers:

```shell
$ npm install
$ npm run build
$ npm run start
```

## ESLint

```shell
# To lint a typescript file:
$ npx eslint server/. pages/.

# Fix lint issues using prettier:
$ npx prettier --write server/. pages/.
```
